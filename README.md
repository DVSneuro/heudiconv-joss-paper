# HeuDiConv JOSS Paper Repository

Separate for the time being to not burden the upstream JOSS issue tracker.

- [authors/](./authors) folder contains tools etc used to populate authors/contributors list

Most recent (but not necessarily up to date) rendering could be found at http://oneukrainian.com/tmp/heudiconv-joss-paper.pdf .
To compile data locally via a docker container, just invoke `make`.
