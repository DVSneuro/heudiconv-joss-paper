Subject: Re-Invitation to co-author a HeuDiConv paper for JOSS

Dear {name},

Thank you for your previous contribution to HeuDiConv (https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv), by code, issues, or feedback!

We are working on a manuscript to be submitted to the Journal of Open Source Software (https://joss.theoj.org) to describe HeuDiConv, and would like to acknowledge your contribution(s).
We are inviting you to co-author the paper, or, alternatively, give us permission to thank you in the Acknowledgements section of the paper.

If you would like to co-author the paper, please review the authorship criteria of JOSS at https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html#authorship and pay particular attention to potential implications of the "co-authors agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work" rule.
If you personally consider a co-authorship appropriate under these conditions, please

- submit a Pull Request with changes to https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv-joss-paper/blob/main/paper.md in which you
  - uncomment (remove leading #) your record
  - add your details (name, ORCID, affiliation) and/or adjust your name (if needed).

If you would like to just be acknowledged, please either reply to this email stating that, or submit a PR with your name appropriately listed in the Acknowledgements section of https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv-joss-paper/blob/main/paper.md and remove the pre-created record with your name from the header.

If you would like to neither be listed among co-authors, nor acknowledged, we would appreciate if you reply and let us know about that.

We are planing to submit the manuscript two weeks (on/after May 20th), and will appreciate if you act on this invitation by the end of the next week.
Co-author records which would remain commented out will be removed before submission.

Thank you again for your contribution to HeuDiConv!

Sincerely,
HeuDiConv "Core Team"
